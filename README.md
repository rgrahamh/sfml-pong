# SFML Pong
An implementation of Pong that I wrote up in SFML.
## Building
First, make sure that you have the development libraries for SFML downloaded. Afer you've resolved that dependancy, you can build the program by typing `make`.
## Running
Type `./pong` in command line after building it and it should run.
## Playing

|   | Up | Down|
|---|----|-----|
|P1 | W  |  S  |
|P2 | UP | DOWN|

And either player can press `SPACE` to cycle if the walls are solid. The ball wraps around if the walls aren't solid.
